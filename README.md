# Triples in dynamic networks  

An algorithm searching for triple patterns in dynamic networks.  

## Pipeline

### 1. Graph Randomization  
This module generates random graphs based on calcium activity data. Here we consider 2 methods based on a randomized sequence of calcium events obtained from experimental data:  
1) shuffling spikes  
2) dynamic shift of spikes

 Example of code is listed in [`1_graph_randomization.ipynb`](notebooks/1_graph_randomization.ipynb)  
### 2. Triple Calculation  
This module performs triple search on a graph and retrieves information associated with behavioral markup.  
Here, we consider only patterns for which exactly two edges in the triple were active while the third was absent [[1]](#1).

Example of code is listed in [`2_triple_calc.ipynb`](notebooks/2_triple_calc.ipynb)  
### 3. Chi-square Calculation  
This module performs a statistical evaluation of the significance of triple activity in relation to behavioral markup.  
Example of code is listed in [`3_chi2_calc.ipynb`](notebooks/3_chi2_calc.ipynb)
